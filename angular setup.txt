first install:
node js

npm install -g @angular/cli@latest ...globally in command promt.
----
to be sure if node js,npm,cli are installed chk out thier version in command prompt
node -v
npm -v
ng v (angular cli version)
install: visual studio code


node verrsion should be higher than angular cli
node version:10.16
angular :8




now go to the project where u can create the angular  project (for eg d:, cd divya/)
then type command as :

d: angular //[ floder name which u have created]

d:angular : ng new angular-tour-of-heroes1  //[create new project inside angular]


cd angular-tour-of-heroes1  //[ go inside the project you have created]
ng serve --open                // [The ng serve command builds the app, starts the development server, watches the source files,
                                   and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files. The --open flag opens a browser to http://localhost:4200/.]
cd src/app/

ng generate interface hero   //  [ if you need to create only one interface ts file]


npm install  //to install node modeul folder

npm install angular 


ng serve   //[ to compile]

ng generate interface hero //[ [ if you need to create only one service ts file]























it create a basic angular 4 project with node js.

**install boostarp in angular 4 **
npn install bootstrap@4.4.3 --save(to install boostrap)
boostrap:"4.4.0" in package.json
in angularcli json...under styles key...addd boostrap style path.
------------





main.ts file  - is the first file which angular complier will see (or which angular will kickstart the application) .....in this file the appplication will be boostraped.
in main.ts there is platformBrowserDynamic, it means that whenever we do some changes in my code it should reflect automatically in front end/browser.

***flow of project ***
from main.ts(first page)...we will come to know root module that is app.module.ts...
and from app.module.ts we will come to know root component that is app.component.ts

** one way binding **
data/property in a class in component, which has to be displayed in view we represent in html page as double curly bracket {{}}
property class => view {{}} :interpolartion/ one way binding. //  here class to view one way binding
view [events] => event handler () for eg (click) :  one way binding.  // here view to class one way binding

class to view {{}}
view to class ()



** to  change the default port 4200 **
package.json => ng serve -p 9200

** attribute binding **
<img src={{img}} >...interpolation..
or
<img [src]=img > ....this is call called attribute binding, where attributes are binded with square brackets[]

<button (click)='adduser()'></button> //data flow from dom to component 


** ng model with two way binding ** [()]
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="">



**some  syntax**
user:User //property
userDetails:User[] //property if u want define with aray

interface User{
 uesrname:string,
 roll:number,
 work:string
}
------
addUser:void(){
this.userDetails.push(user) // since userdetails is an array u can call push function.
}
------
<input type="text" #frstname>
<button onclick='adduser(frstname.value)'></button>
-----
users:user[]
-------
**services**
sharing data btwn components
services page is nothing ucc helper pages.
in app.module.ts.....under providers keys u need to mention services, where it act as a signle to and shares the data btwn tow components.

---
** filters**

inbuilt pipes--
{{bday | date : 'fulldate' | lowercase}}
friday june14 1989
here date:'fulldate' // u can pass the parameters to in built pipes
lowercase //only inbuilt pipes

create a filter/pipe (custom pipes) 
ng g p pipename
refer pipes---with training power(pipe) power(component)
{{value | power:exp}} //here power is the


----
**ng generate**
ng g cl name --class..only one class file (export class name)
ng g c name ---component
ng g s name --service--to share data btwn 2 components service is used.


index.html- is the first file which angular will render to ui..

polyfill.ts  - angular has got standard ecma script version that is (6 version) EC6...but the browser support EC5...to fill that gap polyfill.ts is used
angular-cli.json - its a  json file-configuration file of angular cli used in the project
package.json - all node js dependencies,,like package are included in this file.
 with production dependencies....key as dependencies
and developtment dependencies....key as next devDependencies
----------------------

**lifecyclye hooks**
implenets ngondestroy  ---it will remive the component from ui.

./ means current working directory
-------
What's the difference between tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json?
1) the simplest terms, the tilde matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). ~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.

2) The caret, on the other hand, is more relaxed. It will update you to the most recent major version (the first number). ^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.
